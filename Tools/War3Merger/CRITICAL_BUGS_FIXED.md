# Critical Bugs Fixed - .wtg Deletion & Incorrect Display

## Bug #1: .wtg File Completely Removed from Output Map ‚ùå‚Üí‚úÖ

### What Happened
When you ran:
```bash
TriggerMerger.exe copy-category --source "source.w3x" --target "target.w3x" --category "Spels Heroes"
```

**Result:** The output map `target_merged.w3x` had **NO triggers at all** - the `war3map.wtg` file was completely missing!

### Root Cause
```csharp
// WRONG - Stream lifecycle issue
using var triggerStream = new MemoryStream();
using var writer = new BinaryWriter(triggerStream);
writer.Write(triggers);
triggerStream.Position = 0;

var mpqFile = MpqFile.New(triggerStream, triggerFileName);
builder.AddFile(mpqFile);
builder.SaveTo(outputStream);  // Stream might be disposed or position wrong!
```

The `MemoryStream` was either:
- Disposed before `SaveTo()` could read it, OR
- Had its position at the end instead of the beginning

Result: **Empty or missing .wtg file in output**

### The Fix ‚úÖ
```csharp
// CORRECT - Convert to byte array first
byte[] triggerData;
using (var triggerStream = new MemoryStream())
{
    using var writer = new BinaryWriter(triggerStream);
    writer.Write(triggers);
    triggerData = triggerStream.ToArray();  // ‚úÖ Copy data to byte array
}

// Create NEW stream from byte array - data guaranteed to persist
var newTriggerStream = new MemoryStream(triggerData);
var mpqFile = MpqFile.New(newTriggerStream, triggerFileName);
builder.AddFile(mpqFile);
builder.SaveTo(outputStream);  // ‚úÖ Data is safe!
newTriggerStream.Dispose();
```

**Now works:** The .wtg file is correctly saved with all triggers!

## Bug #2: List Command Shows Incorrect Nesting ‚ùå‚Üí‚úÖ

### What Happened
When you ran:
```bash
TriggerMerger.exe list --map "source.w3x"
```

**You got:**
```
[+] Initialization Maps
  [+] Choice of Race
    [+] Spels Heroes
      [+] Game Bots AI
        [+] Mission 1 Alliance
          ...12 levels deep...
            ‚Ä¢ ALL triggers shown here (WRONG!)
            ‚Ä¢ Book of Archidemon
            ‚Ä¢ Book of Archilich
```

Everything appeared deeply nested, and ALL triggers were shown at the deepest level.

**You expected:**
```
[-] Initialization Maps
  ‚Ä¢ Initialising Game
  ‚Ä¢ Player Camera

[-] Spels Heroes
  ‚Ä¢ Book of Archidemon
  ‚Ä¢ Book of Archilich
  ‚Ä¢ Absorb the Soul

[-] Game Bots AI
  ‚Ä¢ Bots Upgrades Use
  ‚Ä¢ Player Bot Heroes 1
```

Each category at root level with its triggers indented underneath.

### Root Cause

**The Old Code:**
```csharp
var categoryStack = new Stack<(string, int)>();
categoryStack.Push(("", 0));

foreach (var item in triggers.TriggerItems)
{
    if (item is TriggerCategoryDefinition category)
    {
        var level = categoryStack.Peek().Level;
        categoryStack.Push((category.Name, level + 1));  // ‚ùå Only pushes, never pops!
    }
    else if (item is TriggerDefinition trigger)
    {
        var level = categoryStack.Peek().Level;  // ‚ùå Gets deeper and deeper
        // Show trigger at current level
    }
}
```

**The Problem:**
- Code treated every category as nested under the previous one
- Stack only pushed (never popped)
- Every category increased nesting level
- All triggers ended up at maximum depth

**But .wtg files DON'T work this way!**
- Categories are **siblings** (not nested)
- Triggers simply belong to the most recent category
- It's a flat structure in the file

### The Fix ‚úÖ

**The New Code:**
```csharp
// Categories are NOT nested - they're all at the same level
string? currentCategoryName = null;

foreach (var item in triggers.TriggerItems)
{
    if (item is TriggerCategoryDefinition category)
    {
        // ‚úÖ Show category at root level (no nesting)
        Console.WriteLine($"[-] {category.Name}");
        currentCategoryName = category.Name;
    }
    else if (item is TriggerDefinition trigger)
    {
        // ‚úÖ Show trigger indented under its category
        Console.WriteLine($"  ‚Ä¢ {trigger.Name}");
    }
}
```

**Simple algorithm:**
1. Categories shown at root level (no indent)
2. Triggers shown indented under their category (2 spaces)
3. When a new category appears, subsequent triggers belong to it

**Now works correctly:**
```
[-] Spels Heroes
  ‚Ä¢ Book of Archidemon
  ‚Ä¢ Book of Archilich
  ‚Ä¢ Absorb the Soul

[-] Game Bots AI
  ‚Ä¢ Bots Upgrades Use
  ‚Ä¢ Player Bot Heroes 1

[-] Mission 1 Alliance
  ‚Ä¢ Mission 1 Alliance
  ‚Ä¢ Mission 1 Computer Yellow
```

## Files Changed

| File | What Was Fixed |
|------|----------------|
| `Services/TriggerService.cs` | Fixed stream lifecycle - convert to byte array first |
| `Commands/ListCommand.cs` | Fixed category nesting - removed Stack, simple flat display |

---

## How to Get the Fixes

```bash
cd E:\Program\War3Net-claude-war3-wtg-trigger-merger-011CUbTv7bDdjtedCrNc35ZD
git pull origin claude/war3-wtg-trigger-merger-011CUbTv7bDdjtedCrNc35ZD

cd Tools\War3Merger
dotnet build -c Release
```

---

## Testing the Fixes

### Test 1: Copy Category (Bug #1 Fix)
```bash
cd bin\Release\net8.0

TriggerMerger.exe copy-category ^
  --source "source.w3x" ^
  --target "target.w3x" ^
  --category "Spels Heroes"

# Open target_merged.w3x in World Editor
# ‚úÖ The "Spels Heroes" folder should be there with all triggers!
```

### Test 2: List Categories (Bug #2 Fix)
```bash
TriggerMerger.exe list --map "source.w3x"

# ‚úÖ Should show:
# [-] Spels Heroes
#   ‚Ä¢ Trigger 1
#   ‚Ä¢ Trigger 2
# [-] Next Category
#   ‚Ä¢ Trigger 3
```

## Summary

| Bug | Status | Fix |
|-----|--------|-----|
| .wtg file deleted from output | ‚úÖ FIXED | Convert to byte array before creating MpqFile |
| Incorrect category nesting in list | ‚úÖ FIXED | Removed Stack, flat display with simple indent |

**Both critical bugs are now resolved!** üéâ

The tool now:
- ‚úÖ Correctly saves triggers to the output map
- ‚úÖ Displays folder structure properly
