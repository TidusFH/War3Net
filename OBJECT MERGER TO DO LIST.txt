🎯 Key Advantages
Simpler than WTGMerger:

~60% less code (1,500 lines vs 4,200)
No ParentId hell - objects don't have categories
No recursive structures - flat object lists
No file order issues - straightforward copying
Cleaner architecture - Models/Services separation
What Makes It Easier:

Objects are simpler than triggers
No complex hierarchy to maintain
War3Net handles all file formats perfectly
Copy is just clone + add to list
📋 Future Phases (Included as TODOs)
Phase 2 - Dependency Detection (2-3 days):

Auto-detect when units use custom abilities
Auto-detect when abilities use custom buffs
Auto-select all dependencies
Dependency graph visualization
Phase 3 - Smart ID Remapping (2-3 days):

Auto-rename conflicting IDs (h001 → h005)
Update all references automatically
Cross-file reference tracking
The README includes detailed code examples for implementing Phase 2 and 3!
